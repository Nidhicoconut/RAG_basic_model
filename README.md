# RAG_basic_model
This is a basic RAG model which can read the PDF we upload and generate a contextually correct answer.
I have used 'sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2' model for retrieval part'
I have used 'gemini-1.5-flash' model for generation purpose.
I have used Gradio for a user friendly interface.
